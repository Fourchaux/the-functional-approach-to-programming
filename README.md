        The Functional Approach to Programming with Caml
        by Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny
        Cambridge University Press
        ISBN: 0 521 57183 9 (Hardback), SBN: 0 521 57681 4 (Paperback)
and
        Approche Fonctionnelle de la Programmation
        by Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny
        Ediscience International, Collection Informatique
        ISBN 0989-392-X

The directory cl-75 contains the original version, and should run with
Caml-Light 0.75.

I am planning to translate them in OCaml in the near future. Any help
in this task will be appreciated.
